## Note For Future Visitors:

Hey All, This was an attempt to Play **Bad Apple!!** On Any Terminal Using **cURL**,
Like How **"curl Parrot.live"** Works, But In Python.

But, I Have Failed To Do So. Turns Out That It's Not Tat Easy Doing it in Python Only.

Helpful Things:

- I Have The Frames Of **Bad Apple!!** In The `input_images` Folder.
- I Have The Flask App That Shows The Frames In Loops, But No Frames.

Bye. Also Check My GitHub Repos!
